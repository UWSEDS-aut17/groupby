#Requirements

We would need anonymyzed data to analyse usage statistics on different social media. We are planning to use our own social media data to address the project questions. 

Facebook: You can download a dump of your facebook usage data from Facebook website. 

We are researching ways to download self data on Instagram, LinkedIn and Snapchat.
We would also need a common attribute set to join the different datasets,since usernames don't necessarily have to be consistent across social media platforms.
