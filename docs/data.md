# Requirements

We would need anonymyzed data to analyse usage statistics on different social media. We are planning to use our own social media data to address the project questions.
However, since the app is meant for personal use, we need to anonymize ever data set flowing into the system.

Facebook: You can download a dump of your facebook usage data from Facebook website.

We are researching ways to download self data on Instagram, LinkedIn and Snapchat.
We would also need a common attribute set to join the different datasets, since usernames don't necessarily have to be consistent across social media platforms.

# Sources

List the data sets that you are considering using, their content, and their availability.

Facebook.com
Facebook provides with user data, i.e. the messages sent by the user in the recent past, the likes one received, the posts one shared, and so on.
Also available are the list of the user's friends, in addition to the date when the two users became friends.
Information is provided about the events that the user was invited to, which can be used as a judge of how popular the user is.
It remains the intention to link the different sources, to understand one's social media use.

We are researching data retrieval for the following products: Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat. If possible to download, the data will be typically available on the product's website under the user profile. Those are:
 
- Instagram.com
- LinkedIn.com
- SnapChat.com

# Evaluation

As a part of priliminary evaluation, we would be performing some descriptive analysis on the merged data sets.
This would include visualizations indicating various usage metrics for the user such as people the socialize with the most, topics they related to the most etc.

This would also allow them to understand how their usage various depending on the platform they use and the level of engagement in each platform.
