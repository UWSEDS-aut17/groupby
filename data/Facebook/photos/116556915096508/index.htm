It&#039;s so funny isn&#039;t it? The idea that &#039;new statistics&#039; will change anyone&#039;s mind. Should they? The idea that a single data set in, 5, 10, 50 dimensions, could possibly capture the complexity better than a human. In more precision, sure, but more accuracy? Our prior data is so strong that they can hardly ever put a dent. 

Plus, I think to focus on discrete events is to, in some specific sense, to miss the forest for the trees. Those are the discrete events that mobilize people, but it&#039;s just as much the feeling of indignity, frustration, and injustice, felt by the thousands of people who weren&#039;t shot, but were bullied or harassed by law enforcement who relate to the dead. 

The way statistics and SCIENCE interact with our own perceptions and group attachments is pretty shoddy. But it&#039;s an interesting area of study in itself!

The worst part is that random examples are literally the same thing as running a regression and cherry picking your data. 

For all the problems scientific inference still struggles with, it&#039;s always interesting how at least there is a growing understanding that bias in stat methods is bad.

Ideally to the same extent you would not have a typo in your paper, your code and data should be crisp and completely replicate the results.

As I think about this, I think it&#039;s hard for me to sort through what made this seem true to me in college. I agree that it&#039;s a mixture of artificiality and reality, and that other things are as well (so pretty much, everything that exists is real). I just think I didn&#039;t personally have enough initiative while in school to sort out the relevant difference, and that I wasn&#039;t impelled to do that because I always had more music to keep trying to perfect while not thinking about the rest of the world.<div class="meta">Saturday, October 20, 2012 at 7:33pm PDT</div></div><div class="comment"><span class="user">Timothy Krippner</span>Haha, I just read your last two comments. I think I understand the gist of the idea, and it&#039;s definitely one that warrants some precisi- and clarification. Here&#039;s another way of saying what I&#039;m thinking my biggest problem was - I thought the technique exercises for musicians were the more important exercises to undergo.
