Interaction with social media has become a way of life! Since [Facebook data](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467) and other social media data can be downloaded, through our project, we are trying to find patterns of social media use among our team members. We are trying to address the following questions:

1. Is there a trend in usage statistics among our team members on Facebook?
2. How does time spent on Facebook compare with time spent on Instagram, LinkedIn and SnapChat?

We are working on narrowing down these questions and gather what they will accomplish.
