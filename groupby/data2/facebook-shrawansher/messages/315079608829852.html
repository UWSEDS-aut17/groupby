Classics Set For Release on October 26th 

Launched by The Beatles in 1968, as the new outlet for their own recordings as well as the music of an eclectic roster of artists - James Taylor, Badfinger, Billy Preston, Mary Hopkin, Doris Troy, and Jackie Lomax among them - who were all personally brought to the label by The Beatles (individually and/or collectively), Apple Records made popular music history from the very moment it opened its doors. 

Four decades later, Apple Corps Ltd. and EMI Music raise the curtain on remastered CD and digital download releases of 15 key albums from the Apple Records catalog.  All 15 titles will be released on October 26th.  Most of the physical CDs will include bonus material.   

Together, the 15 albums represent the first ever Apple Records releases to be available via digital download.

The Beatles LOVE, the powerful Cirque du Soleil production that celebrates the musical legacy of The Beatles, will be commemorating four years of captivating audiences on June 30, 2010.

In celebration of the show&#039;s anniversary, four cast members from LOVE traveled to Niagara Falls earlier this week to join Ringo at the launch of his upcoming North American concert tour. 

An excerpt from Ringo, featured in the GRAMMY® winning documentary ALL TOGETHER NOW, explains the catalyst LOVE&#039;s Director Dominic Champagne used in creating LOVE with a premise of &quot;four&quot;:

&quot;When you hear that (Beatles&#039;) music, there&#039;s always four people. Doesn&#039;t matter that only Paul and I are sitting here, there&#039;s still four people. There are only two of us now, but in spirit there&#039;s four of us…&quot; – Ringo

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfZU9aTdpEY

Many of LOVE&#039;s most notable characters come in groups of four such as the Nowhere Men, Kids of Liverpool, Skaters, Nurses, Bungee Couples, Comets, Crinyls and Gopis.

The technical design of LOVE was also created with the foundation of four in mind: trampolines, traps on stage, giant balloons, scrims, elevators in the theater, and automation control boards.

As the basis of four prevailed throughout the creation of LOVE, the Beatles&#039; music was beautifully brought to life on stage to deliver a complete entertainment experience. When it came time to choose a name for the show, affection, pleasure, attraction, tenderness and desire seemed to be a reoccurring message in Beatles&#039; music.Coincidentally, these elements were all expressed in just four letters, L-O-V-E.

Additionally, the LOVE album debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 in November 2006. LOVE was also chosen for the past four years as &quot;Best Show” by the Review-Journal&#039;s &quot;Best of Las Vegas” Awards (2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010).</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">The Beatles</span><span class="meta">Tuesday, June 29, 2010 at 10:00am PDT</span></div></div><p>London, England – June 29, 2010 – Eight of John Lennon’s classic solo albums and other standout recordings have been digitally remastered from his original mixes for a global catalogue initiative commemorating the music legend’s 70th birthday, which falls on October 9.

Overseen by Yoko Ono, John Lennon’s “Gimme Some Truth” campaign will launch on 4 October (5 October in North America) with the worldwide release of eight remastered studio albums and several newly-compiled titles.

Double Fantasy, 1980’s GRAMMY Award winner for Album of the Year, will be presented in a newly remixed &#039;Stripped Down&#039; version remixed and produced by Yoko Ono and Jack Douglas, co-producers of the original mix with John Lennon. The new stripped down version of the album comes in an expanded 2CD and digital edition pairing the new version with Lennon’s original mix, remastered.

The campaign’s other new collections include:

· A hits compilation in two editions titled Power To The People: The Hits
· A 4CD set of themed discs titled Gimme Some Truth
· A deluxe 11CD collectors box with the remastered albums, rarities, and non-album singles, titled the John Lennon Signature Box

All of the remastered albums and collections will be available on CD and for download purchase from all major digital service providers

YOKO ONO said: “In this very special year, which would have seen my husband and life partner John reach the age of 70, I hope that this remastering / reissue programme will help bring his incredible music to a whole new audience. By remastering 121 tracks spanning his solo career, I hope also that those who are already familiar with John’s work will find renewed inspiration from his incredible gifts as a songwriter, musician and vocalist and from his power as a commentator on the human condition. His lyrics are as relevant today as they were when they were first written and I can think of no more apposite title for this campaign than those simple yet direct words &#039;Gimme Some Truth&#039;.”

The albums have been digitally remastered from Lennon’s original mixes by Yoko Ono and a team of engineers led by Allan Rouse at EMI Music’s Abbey Road Studios in London and by George Marino at Avatar Studios in New York. All of the remastered titles will be packaged in digisleeves with replicated original album art and booklets with photos and new liner notes by noted British music journalist Paul Du Noyer. The albums to be reissued are:

· John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970)
· Imagine (1971)
· Some Time In New York City (1972)
· Mind Games (1973)
· Walls and Bridges (1974)
· Rock ‘n’ Roll (1975)
· Double Fantasy Stripped Down (2010) / Double Fantasy (1980)
· Milk and Honey (1984)

YOKO ONO added: “Double Fantasy Stripped Down really allows us to focus our attention on John’s amazing vocals. Technology has advanced so much that, conversely, I wanted to use new techniques to really frame these amazing songs and John&#039;s voice as simply as possible. By stripping down some of the instrumentation the power of the songs shines through with an enhanced clarity. Double Fantasy Stripped Down will be complemented by the original album in the 2CD format. It was whilst working on the new version of this album that I was hit hardest emotionally, as this was the last album John released before his passing.&quot;

Power To The People: The Hits gathers 15 of Lennon’s most popular songs, and will be available as a 15-track single-disc and digital package, and as an Experience Edition with additional content. Both versions will be packaged in digisleeves with booklets including a new liner note essay by Du Noyer.

Gimme Some Truth, to be packaged in a slipcase with rare photos and a new liner notes essays by respected American music journalist and author, Anthony DeCurtis, presents 72 of Lennon’s solo recordings on four themed CDs:

· ‘Roots’ – John’s rock ‘n’ roll roots and influences
· ‘Working Class Hero’ – John’s socio-political songs
· ‘Woman’ – John’s love songs
· ‘Borrowed Time’ – John’s songs about life

The John Lennon Signature Box is a deluxe 11CD and digital collection of the eight remastered albums, a disc of rare and previously unreleased recordings, and an EP of Lennon’s non-album singles. The CDs will be housed in digisleeves within a deluxe box including a collectible limited edition John Lennon art print and a hardbound book featuring rare photos, artwork, collages, poetry, and new liner notes by DeCurtis.

One of the world’s most celebrated songwriters and performers of all time, John Lennon was killed at the age of 40 on December 8, 1980. Lennon has been posthumously honoured with a Lifetime Achievement GRAMMY Award and two special BRIT Awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him in the Top 5 of the magazine’s “100 Greatest Singers Of All Time” list.

In celebration of his 70th birthday on 9 October, 2010, John Lennon’s life and music will be specially feted with a variety of commemorative releases and events around the world.

This July 7, 2010 Ringo will turn 70 and he will celebrate his birthday in New York City. At Noon Ringo will be joined by family, friends and fans all together in one simple salute: &quot;Peace &amp; Love&quot;.

The genesis of the July 7 Peace &amp; Love Celebrations began in 2008 when Ringo was asked during an interview with Access Hollywood, &quot;what would you like for your coming birthday?&quot; and he replied &quot;more Peace &amp; Love.&quot; That launched a &quot;Peace &amp; Love&quot; campaign, and Ringo encouraged everyone everywhere to say Peace &amp; Love at Noon their local time. The idea took hold and on July 7 2008, a wave of Peace &amp; Love swept the planet, with Ringo and Barbara joining throngs of fans and Peace &amp; Lovers on the streets of Chicago in front of the Hard Rock Hotel.

The Hard Rock International will once again host various celebrations around the world, with additional spontaneous Peace &amp; Love events cropping up everywhere. (In 2008 Peace &amp; Love events occurred at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, LA, New York, and Florida as well as happening at Abbey Road in London, one at Capitol Records in Los Angeles and one at Strawberry Fields in New York’s Central Park).

Please join the wave of Peace &amp; Love as it continues this July 7 2010. Whether you say it along with a crowd, out loud as you go about your day, Tweet it or simply think the words, we hope you will join Ringo in celebrating “Peace &amp; Love” wherever you are at Noon your local time. 

Post to our Facebook page if you are organising a gathering near you, if you are joining the celebrations, and we will keep this page updated with information about the day!
