U2 tour producer/promoter Arthur Fogel, CEO of Live Nation Global Touring, said, &#039;Although we understand the disappointment to U2 fans, first and foremost comes the recovery of Bono.&#039;

Additional details on rescheduled dates will follow shortly and fans are encouraged to hold on to their tickets.

Bono has now been discharged from Ludwig Maximilians-University (LMU) Hospital in Munich where he underwent emergency surgery on Friday, following a back injury. In order to fully recover, he is under doctor&#039;s orders to start a rehabilitation program and to recuperate for at least eight weeks. 

Paul McGuinness said, &#039;Our biggest and I believe best tour has been interrupted and we&#039;re all devastated. For a performer who lives to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He feels robbed of the chance to do what he does best and feels like he has badly let down the band and their audience. Which is of course nonsense. His concerns about more than a million ticket buyers whose plans have been turned upside down, we all share, but the most important thing right now is that Bono make a full recovery. We&#039;re working as fast as we can with Live Nation to reschedule these dates.&#039;
