I think that weekend I was out too on the sunday for the biking thing to Ramanagaram.

I spent an entire day sleeping at a friend&#039;s house :| But did you get the biscuits? I had sent a box for your house</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Shrawan Sher</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:20am PST</span></div></div><p>I heard the new one is about Luke and Leia&#039;s kids and Harrison Ford,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will be in it, so yeah living upto the father&#039;s/grandfather&#039;s legend would be a part of it, I assume. Gravity was really amazing, it had me hooked for the entire 90 minutes . You saw it in IMAX right?? I saw it on the one here and though its not comparable to the Hyd one at all it was still pretty good. And I have the same feelings on 3D. Usually it gives me a headache or the picture is too dark but this one was actually good on 3D</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Anindita Nayak</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:11am PST</span></div></div><p>In* I hate my tiny keypad and auto correct </p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Anindita Nayak</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:11am PST</span></div></div><p>Ob be on 3d*</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Anindita Nayak</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:10am PST</span></div></div><p>Frankly, I havent given any though yet. But I hope there will a lot more than another son trying to live upto hia father&#039;s or grandad&#039;s legend. It should have a good story and not become another action-only movie. Btw, did you watch gravity? Thats the only 3d movie I thoroughly enjoyed! Star wars will on be in 3d </p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Shrawan Sher</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:06am PST</span></div></div><p>yeah ..there&#039;s a demo next week for a new feature..and Monday and Tuesday I was off so had to work even extra hard..2 nite outs in a row</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Anindita Nayak</span><span class="meta">Sunday, November 10, 2013 at 10:05am PST</span></div></div><p>Woah, working really hard.
